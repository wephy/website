    There is a prevailing sentiment in chess that the synergy of human and machine is the 
    strongest entity, surpassing that of either alone. I believe this idea transcends: if one 
    aims to become the best mathematician, physicist, and problem solver they can be—as 
    I do—harnessing the full power of computers is essential.

    Whilst I hope to delve into many fields in a lengthy career in research, the intersection
    of mathematical physics, many-body physics, and quantum computing within the field
    of tensor networks particularly interests me. The accompanying numerical tools and
    algorithms have emerged as a transformative suite for tackling many-body problems,
    with its core ideas also driving advancements in both regular and quantum machine
    learning.
